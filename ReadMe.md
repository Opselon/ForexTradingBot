## 🛠️ Getting Started (For Developers): Ignite Your Bot 🔥💻

Ready to dive into the codebase and contribute to the evolution of ForexSignalBot? Follow these comprehensive steps to set up the project locally. Our development philosophy emphasizes a `dotnet ducker` approach 🐳, ensuring consistent, isolated, and highly reproducible development environments across various machines. 🚀

1.  **Clone the repository:** Initiate the development process by cloning the project's source code from GitHub:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Opselon/ForexTradingBot.git
    cd ForexTradingBot
    ```
    *This command fetches the code to your local machine.* ⬇️

2.  **Database Setup (PostgreSQL):** ForexSignalBot utilizes PostgreSQL 🐘 for its robust data persistence layer.
    *   Ensure that a PostgreSQL instance is installed, configured, and actively running on your local system or accessible via your network. ✅
    *   Update the `DefaultConnection` string within your `appsettings.json` file (or `appsettings.Development.json` for local development configurations) to correctly point to your operational PostgreSQL instance, including credentials. 🔑
    *   Apply the necessary Entity Framework Core migrations to initialize and update the database schema to the latest version:
        ```bash
        dotnet ef database update --project Infrastructure --startup-project WebAPI
        ```
        *This sets up your database tables.* 🏗️
    *   **Populate RSS Feeds & Categories:** Execute the provided `Populate_RssSources_Categories.sql` script (located in the project root, or execute it directly from your SQL client) against your database. This crucial one-time step will establish the initial categories and populate the comprehensive list of RSS feeds that the bot aggregates. 📡🔄

3.  **Telegram Bot Token:** For the Telegram bot functionality to operate, it requires an authentication token. 🤖
    *   Obtain a unique bot token by interacting with the official `@BotFather` on Telegram. Follow his instructions to create a new bot and retrieve its token. 🤝
    *   Configure your obtained bot token in the `appsettings.json` file under the `TelegramPanelSettings:BotToken` configuration key. 📝

4.  **Hangfire Dashboard (Optional but Recommended):** Hangfire is used for managing background jobs. ⏱️
    *   Configure your Hangfire dashboard path and security settings as needed within `appsettings.json`. This dashboard provides invaluable insights into job processing, failures, and schedules, which is highly recommended for monitoring background operations. 📊🔍

5.  **Build and Run (.NET):** With all prerequisites configured, build and run the application. 🚀
    ```bash
    dotnet build
    dotnet run --project WebAPI # Or use your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, VS Code) to run the WebAPI project.
    ```
    *This compiles and starts your application.* ⚙️

6.  **Docker Integration (Recommended for Production & Consistency - `dotnet ducker`):** Leveraging Docker provides a consistent and isolated environment, crucial for development and deployment. 🐳
    *   To visually represent your Docker setup, a diagram illustrating the containerized architecture (e.g., showing PostgreSQL, WebAPI, and TelegramPanel services running in separate, interconnected containers) would be beneficial here. **(Placeholder for Docker Architecture Diagram)** 🏗️
    *   Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running on your machine to orchestrate the containers. ✅
    *   Build and run all services using Docker Compose, which manages multi-container Docker applications:
        ```bash
        docker-compose build
        docker-compose up
        ```
    *   *This command will orchestrate your PostgreSQL database, WebAPI, and TelegramPanel services within isolated Docker containers, guaranteeing a consistent and scalable development/production environment from the outset, embodying the "dotnet ducker" philosophy.* 🚀📦

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Future Plans: The Path to 2025 and Beyond 🛣️🌟

The **ForexSignalBot** project is on an accelerated trajectory of continuous innovation and strategic expansion. Our ambitious future plans are designed to significantly enhance its capabilities, user experience, and market reach, positioning it as a leading solution in AI-driven financial intelligence:

*   **🧠 Advanced AI/ML Integration:** Our core focus will be on implementing even more sophisticated Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models for deeper, predictive data analysis 📊, developing hyper-personalized market insights tailored to individual user profiles 👤, and building adaptive signaling algorithms that learn and refine over time 🔄, leveraging the latest advancements in deep learning and reinforcement learning. 💡
*   **🌐 Admin & User Web Panel (Full UI Expansion):** We plan to develop a comprehensive, intuitive, and feature-rich web-based management panel. This panel will serve both administrators (for robust system oversight 👁️‍🗨️, efficient user management 👥, content curation ✍️, and granular performance monitoring) and end-users (for seamless subscription management 💳, advanced preference customization 🛠️, detailed historical signal logs with performance metrics, and direct, full control over auto-forwarding integrations and other advanced features beyond what Telegram offers). 📈
*   **➕ Expanded Signal Categories & Asset Classes:** Based on user feedback and evolving market demands, we will progressively introduce new signal categories and significantly broaden the range of supported asset classes. This could include specific indices 📊, various types of bonds 📜, a wider array of cryptocurrencies ₿, and other alternative investments, expanding the bot's utility and appeal to a broader trading audience. 💹
*   **🎯 Enhanced Personalization:** We are committed to providing even more granular and intelligent customization options. This will cover notification types (e.g., critical alerts vs. daily summaries 🔔), frequency settings ⏱️, sophisticated content filters based on individual interests 🔎, and preferred market alerts, giving users unparalleled control over their incoming trading information. 🚀
*   **🔗 Deeper Integration with Trading Platforms (Advanced Auto-Forwarder):** A key strategic initiative is to expand and refine secure, direct integration capabilities with popular external trading platforms (e.g., MetaTrader 4/5 💻, cTrader, TradingView). This would enable more advanced automated signal execution features (always with explicit user consent and robust risk management features), streamlining the trading workflow from signal reception to order placement and potentially offering advanced order types like trailing stops, OCO orders, and integrated position management. This will push the "TL _Wclinet" concept further. 🤝
*   **🤝 Community Features:** To foster a vibrant and collaborative ecosystem around the bot, we envision integrating community features. This could potentially include shared insights 🧠, discussion forums within Telegram groups 💬, collaborative learning features 🎓, and peer-to-peer support, building a thriving community of informed traders. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
